When I moved to the United Stated in August, I experienced a huge cultural shock, especially in regards to sex and gender. As crazy as it may sound, in Brazil, sex and the female body is much more of a taboo than in the US. I was struck by how here, women and men are much more acceptable with talking about sex and acting normal about it. Furthermore, I found the liberal feminist “free the nipple” movement very interesting especially because it would never be acceptable in my society. 

With that in mind, I created the artwork, “Boobies”, to depict the freedom of sexuality in the United States.

I was inspired by a Brazilian fashion designer, Adriana Degreas, that I admire and appreciate her work.
